Easily add custom CSS, JavaScript, HTML and PHP code to unique CJT code blocks and assign them wherever you want.

== Description ==
CSS & JavaScript Toolbox (or CJT) is a powerful and flexible plugin, which allows you to contribute to your WordPress installation code via an easy-to-use web interface. You will be able to modify or extend your site functionality and appearance by adding custom code directly into CJT code blocks and assign them to pages, posts, custom posts, categories, URLs, expressions, and loads more!

= Who is this plugin for? =
The CJT plugin was created to help website authors write their own code. Basically, if love writing code, then you will love CJT. Designed and developed from the ground-up, CJT will suit novice users to seasoned website developers alike. You can also use it as a training tool, and learn step-by-step how to write and apply scripts yourself!  In fact, you will find useful script examples on the CJT website.

= Have you ever thought? =
- Wouldn't it be great to have an easy way to plug your code into a Wordpress installation without having to know how to create a Wordpress plugin OR having to modify files through FTP, etc?
- How nice it would be if you could simply add code that works with WordPress internal code without hacking away at core files?
- How about a nice simple way to change the appearance of a page or post in your Wordpress website?
- What about a means to organise your scripts and blocks of code in a simple web interface?

= How can CJT help you? =
- The CJT plugin allows you to contribute to your Wordpress installation code via a simple web interface. You can modify and extend the functionality and appearance of your website by writing code directly into CJT code blocks.
- Each code block represents a script (or block of code) that can apply/execute/output to a specific location (e.g. pages, posts, categories, etc) as defined in the Assignment Panel.
- With CJT code blocks, you can add various types of code like CSS, JavaScript, HTML and PHP.  You can mix them into a single block or organise them into multiple separate blocks - the choice is yours.
- The Auxiliary tab provides more 'assignment' options. Things like WordPress common requests such as: 404 Error, Tag, Archive, Entire website, Front-end, Dashboard Backend, and a number of others. 
- You can create multiple code blocks, assign them to the same requests or different requests.
- Manage all of your code blocks through a single webpage using Ajax requests.  No need to refresh your pages for any operation you need to make.
- Changing the blocks order (via block dragging) allows you to specify what code block is used first. This way later blocks are overridden by higher-order code blocks.
- By Deactivating code blocks, you can disable a code block from running. Using this feature is handy to test the behaviour you expected your block to make without changing a blocks properties (i.e. code, assigned requests).
- All code blocks can have a unique name, which is ideal for organising and remembering the purpose of your block.
- Output location is the location/point/hook for the block code to run. CJT now only supports two hook points - Header and Footer, which outputs code block in the page header - exactly before the closing HTML 'head' tag OR in the page footer - just before the end of the 'body' tag.
- Integrating with [ACE Editor](http://ace.ajax.org/)! CJT proudly and perfectly integrates the ACE Editor and it is a dream to use while writing code for its smooth response, high performance and syntax highlighting.
- We have included a number of tools for batch processing like: 'Delete All Empty Blocks', 'Delete All', 'Activate All', 'Deactivate All', 'Revert State'.
- Individual code block Revisions can be saved.  Also, you can entirely save all of your code blocks with the Backups feature.

3. Click 'CSS & JavaScript Toolbox' link in the main navigation (left side of your Dashboard).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why was the CJT plugin developed and what is it used for? =
The CJT plugin was created to help website authors write their own code. The plugin allows you to contribute to your Wordpress installation code via a simple web interface, where you can modify and extend the functionality and appearance of your website by writing code directly into CJT code blocks. A typical example of using the plugin can include changing the the way a specific Wordpress page is displayed, or making a page more interactive by adding some JavaScript (Dynamic HTML).

= What is a CJT 'code block'? =
The CJT code block is the basic unit for writing code and to associate it with specific Wordpress requests.

= What is the Assignment Panel? =
The Assignment Panel is a tabs window, which appears on the right side of the code block editor and is used to assign/apply the code block into specific requests.

= Can you select more than one item from the Assignment Panel? = 
Yes! You can select any number of items you need, there is no limitation regarding this.

= Can you assign multiple blocks to the same items from the Assignment Panel? =
Yes! It's one of the most useful features that CJT supports as it allows you to manage/split your codes into several code blocks, allowing you to override code in a former (or lower ordered) code block.

= What is Pages, Posts, Categories and Custom Posts tabs? =
These lists with checkboxes represent all of your WordPress Pages, Posts, Categories and Custom Posts that your entire website contains.  It also supports subpages and sub-categories, which you will also find in there. 

= What is the Auxiliary tab? =
As there are a number of requests that are not available as normal Wordpress items (e.g. Pages, Posts, etc) but since it's commonly required and most likely be used, you will find them pre-defined in the Auxiliary tab. In the Auxiliary tab you can find pages like: Home, Blog Index, Author, 404 error, Tag, Archive, Entire website, Front-end, Admin backend and much more!

= Is it better to use the URLs tab, or should I select items if found through other tabs?  =
Pages, Posts, Custom Posts and Categories tabs are created to simplify the assignment process for all types of users. Using URLs is great for fast performance as it requires less time to evaluate/identify the request! However, not all things can be done through the URLs tab.  For example, applying a single block to a Category index page and all its sub-categories.

= What is the Advanced Expressions tab? =
The Advanced Expression tab allows you to fully control what requests to integrate into the code block by using Regular Expressions. In other words, allowing CJT users to define more requests to assign the code block to.

= Can I move the blocks around? =
Yes by hovering your mouse cursor over the code block title bar until it turns into a four-sided arrow, this allow you to move the blocks.  Clicking the block title bar allows you to open and close the blocks.

= Is block immediately saved after I clicked 'create' on 'Create New Code Block' form? =
Yes! The block is created and saved in your database, to discard the block you've to delete it.

= Is block orders immediately saved after drag-and-drop block box?  =
No! In order to save blocks order you need to press 'Save All Changes' button.

= Is block immediately deleted after removed from the blocks list page? =
No! After delete block you need to click 'Save All Changes' button.

= I'm using the URLs tab and my code is not working? =
Make sure you have copied and pasted the Page, Post, or Category URL exactly as it appears in the address bar.  For example, you may have inadvertently included an extra forward slash at the end of your URL.

= Why use the Footer switch in Location/Hook? =
Hook location feature gives you control over the location of outputting the CSS/JS code. This is useful in case overriding another plugins' CSS is required. Also sometimes its better to put your JS code in the footer to avoid slowing down your page load.

= I received a weird error, what do I do now? =
Sometimes a bug decides to rear its ugly head and when this happens, this is when we need your help.  If you receive an error, if it be a PHP error, or some functionality that isn't working for whatever reason, please visit our: [CSS & JavaScript Toolbox website and let us know](http://css-javascript-toolbox.com/support/plugin/css-javascript-toolbox-forum)
